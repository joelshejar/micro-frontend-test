## Post #1 - Bootstrap Phase (October 30, 2025)

🚀 **Building a Micro-Frontend Architecture from Scratch!**

I'm excited to share my journey of building a production-ready micro-frontend system using modern web technologies. Here's what I accomplished in Phase 1:

**📦 Project Setup:**
✅ Configured pnpm 9 monorepo with workspaces
✅ Set up Turborepo for optimized build orchestration
✅ Implemented TypeScript 5.9 with strict mode
✅ Created scalable folder structure (apps/ & packages/)
✅ Configured development tooling (Prettier, TSConfig)

**🛠️ Tech Stack:**
• Package Manager: pnpm (fast, efficient, disk-space friendly)
• Build Tool: Turborepo (parallel builds, smart caching)
• Language: TypeScript (type safety at scale)
• Node: v20.13.1 (locked with .nvmrc)

**📂 Monorepo Structure:**
The workspace is organized for maximum flexibility:
- `apps/*` - Host & remote micro-frontends
- `packages/*` - Shared libraries & utilities

**🎯 Why Micro-Frontends?**
Micro-frontends enable:
• Independent deployments per team
• Technology agnostic approach
• Better scalability for large applications
• Isolated testing and development

**Next Steps:**
Phase 2 will focus on:
- Module Federation configuration
- Host application setup
- Creating remote micro-apps
- Shared component library

This is a learning journey, and I'll be documenting every step. Follow along if you're interested in modern frontend architecture!

💡 What's your experience with micro-frontends? Have you faced any challenges scaling frontend applications?

## Tips for LinkedIn Posts

1. **Keep it professional but personal** - Share what you learned
2. **Use emojis sparingly** - They help with readability
3. **Ask questions** - Encourage engagement at the end
4. **Use relevant hashtags** - 5-10 relevant tags
5. **Add media** - Screenshots of your setup or architecture diagrams
6. **Be consistent** - Post updates regularly
