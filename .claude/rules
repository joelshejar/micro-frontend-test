- ✅ Include SPECIFIC technical details
- ✅ Mention REAL challenges faced and solutions
- ✅ Use code snippets from actual implementation
- ✅ Be authentic and honest about learnings

- ❌ Use placeholder text or "coming soon"
- ❌ Skip documentation updates
- ❌ Backdate or future-date entries

## 📝 CHANGELOG Entry Requirements

Each entry MUST include:

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD (Month Day, Year)

### Phase/Feature Name

**What was built:**
- Specific feature/component 1
- Specific feature/component 2
- Configuration details

**Files created/modified:**
- path/to/file.ts - What it does
- path/to/config.json - Purpose

**Key decisions:**
- Decision 1 with technical rationale
- Decision 2 with technical rationale

**Challenges solved:**

  Solution: Specific solution implemented

**What's working:**

```

## 🎯 When to Generate Posts

Generate new posts ONLY when:
- ✅ Significant feature/component completed
- ✅ Major configuration/setup finished
- ✅ Important architectural decision made
- ✅ Multiple related tasks completed on same day

Skip post generation for:
- ❌ Minor bug fixes
- ❌ Trivial config changes
- ❌ Documentation-only updates
- ❌ Small refactorings

## 📅 Date-Based Organization

- Posts are organized by DATE, not by sequential numbers
- Use format: YYYY-MM-DD - Descriptive Title
- Most recent date at the top
- Maintain chronological order (newest first)

## 🔄 Workflow Summary

When user says "I'm done" or session ends:
1. Review all changes made
2. Update CHANGELOG.md with dated entry
3. Generate LinkedIn post from CHANGELOG
4. Generate Twitter thread from CHANGELOG
5. Update README.md timeline
6. Confirm all documentation is updated
