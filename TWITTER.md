📦 Tech Stack Choices:

• pnpm 9 - Fast, efficient package manager
• Turborepo 2.5 - Smart build orchestration
• TypeScript 5.9 - Type safety at scale
• Node 20.13.1 - Latest LTS

Why these? Performance + DX + Scalability

🏗️ Monorepo Structure:

```
micro-frontend-test/
├── apps/      → Host & remote apps
├── packages/  → Shared libraries
├── turbo.json → Build pipeline
└── pnpm-workspace.yaml
```

Clean separation, easy scaling!

⚡ Turborepo Benefits:

✅ Parallel builds (save time)
✅ Smart caching (build once)
✅ Task dependencies (proper order)
✅ Remote caching (team sync)

This will be crucial when we add multiple apps!

## Quick Post Ideas

### Achievement Posts
```
✅ Just configured a production-ready monorepo with:
• pnpm workspaces
• Turborepo
• TypeScript

Next: Module Federation for micro-frontends! 🚀

```

### Learning Posts
```
💡 TIL: Turborepo's caching can reduce build times by 85%+ in monorepos!

Game changer for large-scale frontend projects.

## X/Twitter Best Practices

1. **First tweet hooks readers** - Make it compelling!
2. **Use thread numbers** - (1/7, 2/7, etc.)
3. **One idea per tweet** - Keep it focused
4. **Use emojis** - More accepted on Twitter than LinkedIn
5. **Add code blocks sparingly** - Use for structure/commands
6. **End with CTA** - Ask questions, request engagement
7. **Use 2-3 hashtags max** - Don't overdo it
8. **Visual content** - Screenshots get more engagement
9. **Post timing** - 9-11 AM or 5-6 PM (your timezone)
10. **Engage back** - Reply to comments quickly
